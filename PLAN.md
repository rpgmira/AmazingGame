# AmazingGame — Development Plan

## Decisions Log

Decisions that have been made so far:

- [x] **Platform**: Browser-based (HTML5 Canvas / WebGL)
- [x] **Players**: Single player
- [x] **Scope**: Medium side project (a few weeks — core mechanics + polish)
- [x] **Game Framework**: Phaser 3 (v3.90.0) — 2D game framework with Canvas & WebGL rendering
- [ ] **Genre**: Not yet decided
- [ ] **Theme / Setting**: Not yet decided
- [ ] **Core gameplay loop**: Not yet decided
- [x] **Language**: TypeScript
- [x] **Build tool**: Vite
- [x] **Architecture pattern**: Scene-based (Phaser built-in)

## Phase 0 — Concept & Planning

- [x] Choose platform and scope
- [ ] Define genre and theme
- [ ] Define core gameplay loop
- [ ] Choose language (TypeScript / JavaScript)
- [ ] Choose rendering approach
- [ ] Choose build tool
- [x] Define project architecture
- [ ] Finalize folder structure

## Phase 1 — Project Setup

- [ ] Initialize project (package.json, config files)
- [ ] Set up build tool and dev server
- [ ] Create HTML entry point with canvas
- [ ] Implement basic game loop (update/render cycle)
- [ ] Verify hot-reload and dev workflow

## Phase 2 — Core Architecture

- [ ] Implement core abstractions (entities, scenes, etc.)
- [ ] Input handling (keyboard / mouse)
- [ ] Basic rendering pipeline
- [ ] Asset loading utilities
- [ ] Math / vector helpers

## Phase 3 — Player & Movement

- [ ] Create player entity
- [ ] Keyboard-driven movement
- [ ] Camera / viewport (if needed)
- [ ] Basic collision detection

## Phase 4 — Gameplay Mechanics

- [ ] Define and implement core mechanics (TBD based on genre)
- [ ] Enemy / obstacle behavior
- [ ] Scoring / progression system
- [ ] Game states (menu, play, pause, game over)

## Phase 5 — Content & Polish

- [ ] Level design / procedural generation
- [ ] Art assets and animations
- [ ] Sound effects and music
- [ ] UI (HUD, menus, transitions)
- [ ] Playtesting and balance

## Phase 6 — Release

- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Cross-browser testing
- [ ] Build for production
- [ ] Deploy (GitHub Pages, itch.io, etc.)
